<h1> Hi there, it's Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Th√†nh. :raising_hand_man:  :penguin: </h1>
:man_student: I'm studying E-Commerce at **UIT**. 
_(University of Information Technology, Vietnam national university, HCMC)_

**Where I'm headed:**

My main focus lies in **backend development**, specifically utilizing Node.js and its robust ecosystem. 

I'm excited to explore the possibilities of building efficient and scalable server-side applications that power engaging and dynamic user experiences.

**My tech stack:**
* Backend:<img alt="Nodejs" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Nodejs-43853d?style=flat-square&logo=Node.js&logoColor=white" />, Express.js, RESTful APIs, <img alt="MongoDB" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-MongoDB-13aa52?style=flat-square&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white" />
* Version control: <img alt="git" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Git-F05032?style=flat-square&logo=git&logoColor=white" />, GitHub
* Other tools: Docker, Postman
**Exploring and learning:**

I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and growth. I'm always on the lookout for new technologies and frameworks to broaden my skillset, with a particular interest in:

+ <img alt="TypeScript" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-007ACC?style=flat-square&logo=typescript&logoColor=white" />
+ <img alt="React" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-45b8d8?style=flat-square&logo=react&logoColor=white" />


+ Cloud platforms like AWS and GCP for scalable deployments

+ Microservices architecture for modular and efficient development
