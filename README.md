### Hi there, it's Nguyá»…n Há»¯u ThÃ nh profile.  ðŸ‘‹
I'm studying E-Commerce at UIT. (University of Information Technology, Vietnam national university, HCMC)
** Where I'm headed:**
My main focus lies in backend development, specifically utilizing Node.js and its robust ecosystem. I'm excited to explore the possibilities of building efficient and scalable server-side applications that power engaging and dynamic user experiences.

My tech stack:

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, RESTful APIs, MongoDB
Version control: Git, GitHub
Other tools: Docker, Postman
** Exploring and learning:**

I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and growth. I'm always on the lookout for new technologies and frameworks to broaden my skillset, with a particular interest in:

TypeScript for robust and maintainable code
Cloud platforms like AWS and GCP for scalable deployments
Microservices architecture for modular and efficient development
** Let's connect!**

I'm always eager to network with fellow developers, learn from others, and contribute to open-source projects. Feel free to reach out and connect with me on LinkedIn or GitHub!
