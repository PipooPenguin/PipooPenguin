### Hi there, it's Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Th√†nh. :raising_hand_man:  :penguin: 
:man_student: I'm studying E-Commerce at **UIT**. 
_(University of Information Technology, Vietnam national university, HCMC)_

**Where I'm headed:**

My main focus lies in **backend development**, specifically utilizing Node.js and its robust ecosystem. 

I'm excited to explore the possibilities of building efficient and scalable server-side applications that power engaging and dynamic user experiences.

**My tech stack:**
* Backend: Node.js, Express.js, RESTful APIs, MongoDB
* Version control: Git, GitHub
* Other tools: Docker, Postman
**Exploring and learning:**

I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and growth. I'm always on the lookout for new technologies and frameworks to broaden my skillset, with a particular interest in:

+ TypeScript for robust and maintainable code

+ Cloud platforms like AWS and GCP for scalable deployments

+ Microservices architecture for modular and efficient development

**Let's connect!**
